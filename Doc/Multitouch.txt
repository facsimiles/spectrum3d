MULTITOUCH SUPPORT FOR SPECTRUM 3D

Multitouch support in Spectrum3d is still experimental for now. It is provided by the uTouch-geis API (Geis2).

Where to get general information about multitouch?
--------------------------------------------------
For general information about multitouch in Ubuntu, you can refer to : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch

Where to get it?
----------------
It is available from Natty's repositories. For Maverick, it has to be installed from the uTouch-geis website(the libutouch-geis-dev in the Maverick's repositories is the Geis1 API and we are using Geis2 here). A convenient way to do that on Maverick is :
	- first uninstall libutouch-geis-dev  and libutouch-geis if you have them installed;
	- type in a terminal : sudo apt-get build-dep libutouch-geis-dev  (this will get all the needed dependencied to build Geis2);
	- then download the source package from uTouch-Geis website (https://launchpad.net/canonical-multitouch/utouch-geis) and follow the instruction from the INSTALL file; steps should include go in the source package directory, then ./configure, make, make install.

How is it implemented in Spectrum3d?
------------------------------------
For now, the whole screen receives fingers input for Spectrum3d while Spectrum3d is running (input is not limited to the Spectrum3d window). On the other hand, when Sprectrum3d is running, the mouse pointer cannot be used from the touchpoint on the screen, but the mouse pointer is still drived by the mouse. This behaviour could be the same in Natty, if you have a touchpad that supports multitouch : the touchpad only receives input as multitouch gestures, and you cannot use it anymore to drive the mouse as long as Spectrum 3d is running. 

Only one and two fingers gestures have been implemented untill now since most of the touchscreen supports only 2 fingers gestures. On the other hand, as gestures can be used at a system wide level, it seems that 2 fingers gestures are better application-specific, while 3 or 4 fingers gestures apply to window or system management.

A possible future alternative : Ginn
------------------------------------
If you don't want to use uTouch-geis, it should be possible to use the excellent 'Ginn' software (https://launchpad.net/canonical-multitouch/ginn) that allows to "inject" gestures without installing the geis API. However, since Spectrum3d uses SDL, Ginn cannot yet "inject" gestures in such kind of windows, but the developpers are planning to do it. When it will be possible, Ginn will have to be started as root.
